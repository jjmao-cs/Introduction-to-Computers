# Factorial of a nonnegative integer

## Description
- The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written :N!=N*(N-1)*….*2*1

## Quest
1. write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial EX:5!=5*4*3*2*1=120
2. write a program that estimates the value x of  𝑒^x = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! +… 
3. write a program that compute the value of 𝑒^𝑥 = 1 + 𝑥/1! + 𝑥^2/2! + 𝑥^3/3! +…,  −∞<𝑥<∞
